# Session log — observability trace

One block per working session, newest at the bottom. Record what was actually run and what it

## 2026-09-23 · Stage 0 · Planning + foundation
- Model/effort: Opus 5.5, plan mode then execution.
- Inputs read: kickoff brief (.docx, via zip/XML extraction), vision deck (40-page image PDF,
  rendered to PNG with PyMuPDF and read page by page), logo JPEG (colours sampled with Pillow),
  Frontend Master Blueprint (full), Hungry Anna governance (via Explore subagent), past-project
  lessons + Jev wiring (via Explore subagent), context-head skill.
- Subagents: 2 Explore agents (read-only). Their reports were treated as evidence; the load-bearing
  hook and settings files were read directly before porting.
- Questions asked: 4 rounds (13 questions); answers became D-001..D-016.
- Commands run → result: context-head --check exit 0; docs-check exit 0; 5 break tests exit 1 as
  intended; hook suite 19/19 PASS; Jev isPrivate as expected. Full detail in D-017.
- Fixed during verification: post-edit hook errored on scratchpad writes (now skips outside paths);
  bash-guards false-positived on any command mentioning drizzle-kit + push (now checks the subcommand).
- Not verified: see D-017.
- Next: first commit (awaiting Sasanka's permission) → Stage 1 (owner questions out, logo SVG).
